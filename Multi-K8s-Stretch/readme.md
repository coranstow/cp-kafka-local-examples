# Multi DC Example using k8s Clusters

This demo is designed to demonstrate the deployment of Confluent Platform stretched across two Kubernetes clusters. This driven by the intersection of two separate business requirements:
1. Standardise everything onto Kubernetes as a common Platform.
2. Stretch Confluent Platform across regions to provide HA/DR. See https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/multi-dc-deployments/index.html

One of the challenges is that for all its strengths as an application platform, Kubernetes actually gets in the way a bit for middleware systems that are distributed and stateful.

In the case of a single Kubernetes cluster we can use StatefulSets to manage the ZooKeeper and Kafka nodes, each of which must have a distinct ID. When we are stretching the Confluent cluster acres multiple Kubernetes Clusters, however, we need to more carefully manage how ZooKeeper and Kafka IDs are created so that they don't collide.

We also have to go to some effort to ensure that all of the nodes in each cluster that need to talk to each other can do so. For this we need to configure our Kubernetes services so that all the nodes can talk to all f the other nodes that they need to talk to.

Why even use Kubernetes when this would be much simpler with just some VMs? Well, because sometimes you are told to use Kubernetes and that's all there is to it.

## Assumes
* You have access to one or more Kubernetes Clusters
* You have Clusters admin access to the k8s Clusters

## Prerequisites

This was developed and tested on Kubernetes Clusters on AWS.

1. Helm
2. Kubectl


## Preparation

1. Prepare two Kubernetes clusters, henceforth referred to as `cluster-0` and `cluster-1`.
2. Deploy Confluent Platform to `cluster-0` using the Helm charts at https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-helm-charts.

I don't think the Confluent Operator will support what we're trying to do here, so we'll use Helm for the installation instead of the Confluent Operator.

## Process

There are two Kubernetes clusters to work on in parallel - be prepared for some context switching, or multiple, independent shells.
